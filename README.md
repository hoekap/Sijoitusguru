A simple tkinter application to follow stocks in realtime


Realtime depends on Google Finance service. Also this is the first free-form
project I have ever written.


## Known bugs
- Automatic scaling of the graph doesn't work
- Price of high value stocks (large number) overlaps other stuff
- Moving the elements after 1 hour runtime doesn't work correctly
